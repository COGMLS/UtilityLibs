# Version Library

The VersionLib is a versioning library for other libraries and applications to make easier the implementation of version number control with tests to analyze if the value greater, equal, if is a release or alpha build type. It's possible to check if the version is marked as incompatible with an application or library, using an know list of versions, provided by the dependency application or library and test it, with support to generate an exception or not.

The VersionLib contains all necessary methods and data type needed to work, allowing to consume this library without dependencies. All VersionLib methods, data types and classes, are inside the namespace `VersionLib`.

**IMPORTANT:** *This library is under development and the methods may not work as expected. It's important to be aware about possible modifications that may break or be compatible with previous feature during the development time.*
